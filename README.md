I just built a sleek, dark-themed crypto influencer leaderboard with the following features

Modern UI with a gradient header and clean table design
Rank indicators with different colors for top 3 positions
Profile display with avatar, name, and Twitter handle
Key metrics:
Total coins shilled
Number of rugged coins
Number of successful coins (100%+ gain)
Rug pull percentage
Visual indicators using Lucide icons
Responsive design that works on all screen sizes
